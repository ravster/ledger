        <!-- Yes, I'm using JQuery on purpose, in 2024.
            This works, and it's a lot less code than the 271MB that gets pulled down when I do "npx create-react-app". This is leaner, and meaner, and it just works.
            "Just works" is a part of developer experience that people seem to have just forgotten. Or, modern JS devs never really knew about it because they're too young to remember 15 years ago.
            JQuery master race.
